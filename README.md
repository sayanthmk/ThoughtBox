## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real-time Currency Conversion** â€“ Fetches the latest exchange rates from API.
- **Offline Support** â€“ Works even without an internet connection.
- **Data Caching** â€“ Stores the most recent fetched rates in local storage using **Hive**.
- **API Failure Handling** â€“ Falls back to cached values when the API fails.
- **Rate Expiry Check** â€“ Warns if the rate is older than 5 minutes.

---

## âš™ How Offline Mode Works

- When online, the app fetches live exchange rates from the API and **stores** them locally using **Hive**.
- If the same currency pair is requested within **5 minutes**, the app uses the **cached value** instead of making another API call.
- If the API request fails, the app will use the last cached value (if it is less than **30 minutes old**).
- If the cached value is older than **5 minutes**, the app shows a warning to the user.
